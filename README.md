# site-restaurant
Restaurant-site in html,css
## site-restaurant 2
i wrote this site to practice my skills in writing html coding with css binding.
The site is composed of four windows, each window was planned so that it looks simple and
juicy for every client who can easily order a service in a restaurant.
